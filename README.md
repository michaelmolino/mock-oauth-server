## Mock Oauth Server

This is a mock and very insecure oauth server. It's completely accessible, doesn't validate any tokens, and always returns the same hardcoded user info. Based on docs [here](https://medium.com/@darutk/diagrams-and-movies-of-all-the-oauth-2-0-flows-194f3c3ade85). I've implemented the bare minimum to get it working with [fotrino](https://www.fotrino.com/).
